<h1>Analysis, Fall \(2014\)</h1>

<p>
<b>Tuesday, Thursday 11:00-12:15</b> @  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Courant+Institute+of+Mathematical+Sciences/@40.728606,-73.99572,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c259906cef3d29:0x92ae4b4cef3674db">Warren Weaver Hall (WWH)</a>, Room \(317\)<br>

Office: WWH, 1105A. Office hours: Wednesdays \(3\) PM-\(5\) PM or by appointment

<p>
<b><big>Syllabus</big></b>:
This course is an introduction to rigorous analysis on the real line. Topics include: the real number system, sequences and series of numbers, functions of a real variable (continuity and differentiability), the Riemann integral, basic topological notions in a metric space, sequences and series of functions including Taylor and Fourier series.
</p>

<p>
<b><big>Textbook</big></b>:
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Introduction to Real Analysis, 4th Edition</i>, by Robert G. Bartle, Donald R. Sherbert</b>
</p>
We will attempt to cover the entire book. Depending on time, we may omit Chapter \(10\) or \(11\) or both. I will also post notes if and when required.  
<p>
Other recommended texts:
</p>
<li>
<b><i>Principles of mathematical analysis</i>, by Rudin</b>
</li>
<li>
<b><i>Elementary analysis: the theory of calculus</i>, by Ross</b>
</li>

<p>
This course is a proof based course. Some useful texts on this front are:
</p>
<li>
<b><i>Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics</i>, by Gary Chartrand, Albert D. Polimeni and Ping Zhang</b>
</li>
<li>
<b><i>The Nuts And Bolts of Proofs</i>, by Antonella Cupillari </b>
</li>

<p>
For this course, we can get away with very basic naive set theory. For more details, below are some useful texts on this front:
</p>
<li>
<b><i>Naive Set Theory</i>, by Paul R. Halmos</b>
</li>
<li>
<b><i>Introduction to the theory of sets</i>, by Joseph Breuer</b>
</li>

<p>

<b><big>PLEASE READ THIS</big></b>: <b><i> It is most important that you regularly read the textbook and notes posted. You are also strongly encouraged to read the other recommended texts. Given that this is the first rigorous mathematics course for most of you, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to keep pace with the material presented without reading the textbook and notes. You are strongly encouraged to attend office hours. The most efficient way to learn this subject is to work out a lot of problems, problems, and more problems (exercises and examples from the book provide a wonderful opportunity) apart from homework problems. Getting a feel for definitions, theorems, etc will take time and this is where doing problems will help you to build your intuition on why things are defined in a specific way and why are certain theorems useful. Getting confused with analysis is a common phenomenon for most students. Spending sufficient time to understand a theorem is also common. Whenever you read a theorem, try to construct counterexamples (The textbook <b><i>"Counterexamples in Analysis"</i>, by Bernard R. Gelbaum and John M. H. Olmsted </b> is extremely useful on this front) by invaliding a particular assumption of the theorem. Some concepts are genuinely challenging and hard (especially since you will be learning it for the first time), but that's what makes this class entertaining and fun.</i></b>

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>There will be a total of \(12\) written homework. Homework will be posted on this website and will be <b><i>due on Friday during recitations</i></b>. <b>Late homework will not be accepted</b>. Graded assignments will be returned to students during the recitations.</p>

<p>Grader(s) will be expecting you to express your ideas clearly, legibly, and completely, often requiring complete English sentences rather than merely just a long string of equations or unconnected mathematical expressions. This means you could lose points for poorly written proofs or answers. Clear exposition is a crucial ingredient of mathematical communication. Clarity of thought and presentation is more important in mathematics than any other field. The only way to master exposition is by repeated practicing. Read a proof from a book, then try to articulate and write the proof in your own words. Then proof read, imagining that someone else wrote the exposition and try to figure out, which parts need more work and are difficult to comprehend. You will be receiving feedback on your homework and you should use this feedback to present your work better the next time.</p>

<b>If the assignment is not stapled, the grader is not responsible for losing your work</b>.
</font>

<h2>Quiz</h2>
<p>There will be short (\(5\)-\(10\) minutes) quiz each week either in class or during recitations.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
Midterm-I : <b>October 7th, Tuesday in class</b>.
</p>

<p>
Midterm-II : <b>November 13th, Thursday in class</b>.
</p>

<p>
Final exam : mid December. (Exact date, time, venue will be announced later)
</p>

<p>
<b>There will be no make up exams. All exams will be closed book, closed notes. No internet/calculator allowed.</b>
